# Hypertext TV

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/43950a45-1b69-4368-bae0-3948cf8b769c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hypertext-tv/deploys)

## What's this?

Hypertext TV is a celebration of small, handmade games and sites. Sites air at a particular day and time each week. Come back at different times to see different sites!

## Why?

Most platforms on the web offer on-demand access to practically limitless content. At the same time, platforms algorithmically tailor content to keep us engaged and online. Experiences are individualized—each person has a different feed, and a different sense of time as they navigate that feed.

Television and radio offer an alternative means of programming: a shared schedule, with programs airing at a particular time of day, experienced collectively.

Could we bring this to the web? What if a website went offline at a particular time of day? What if your favorite sites only aired once a week, for a limited time? How would that shape your interaction online? How would that shape your relation with others?

Hypertext TV is an attempt to imagine that shared schedule for the web: limited, unalgorithmic, collective. Explore what's airing today. Maybe you'll discover something new.

## Can I add my games/sites/art to the TV schedule?

You can! Check out the [contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
